Around this haunted time of year,
Many people go out and cheer.
I like to stay inside instead,
And think of all the imaginations in my head.
Sometimes I am up til' three or four,
But sometimes I tried to stay up more.
Reading is one of those that is fun,
It makes my mind run.
Ive read a lot of creepy books around this time.
Like ones about toes, vipers, and a white gown,
When read in the dark would make any kid frown.
And ones about a creepy world in the new house,
that made me shiver like a "terror" button was sewed on me.
And lastly, a collection of Dark Tales,
Which has the greatest posibilty of evil and to go off the rails.
They were connected, I noticed, as time went on
All had green items, as I my mind began to dawn.
The first was the first of the ? section.
The second was in the ? chapter.
And the last was ? green items on that page.
Find the 3 letters of these item's first character.
One more connection I saw,
A number that will help you find these all.
The odd one out of the bunch,
In this riddle, I have a hunch.
