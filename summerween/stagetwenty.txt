Hello! And congratulations on making it this far! As a gift to you,
this stage is fairly easy and fun in order to give you a break from
the research and time heavy stages you have been through. The last
five stages all have something very special about them, and here is
a sneak peak at their titles...


Stage Twenty-One: Night Light
Stage Twenty-Two: Time is Ticking

Stage Twenty-Three: Inferno	 
Stage Twenty-Four: Purgatorio	
Stage Twenty-Five: Paradiso

For this stage, I am looking for three numbers but together, the first
consists of two numbers, the second consists of three, and the third consists
of four.

(Hint, all numbers have a "1" in them)
