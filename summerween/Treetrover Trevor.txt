The Song of Treetrover Trevor


Treetrover Trevor took his trove,
Treetrover Trevor was very old,
Treetrover Trevor heard a sound,
Treetrover Trevor hit the ground.

Treetrover Trevor took his trove,
Treetrover Trevor was very old,
Treetrover Trevor heard a sound,
Treetrover Trevor hit the ground.

Before Treetrover crashed and burned,
Treetrover Trevor turned and turned.

First he was a cowboy tall and alone,
Then he played on the end zone,
The bears past the rams was a common sight,
But he didnt go down raiders without a fight.

When he reached the spire view,
He laughed at the swan that he didnt choose,
At the straight of the floral hall,
He was raised in Loudoun in the fall.

At the end of this long drawn-out path,
Treetrover Trevor took a nap,
He layed right next to the grass and mold,
Then his body was dead and cold.

Treetrover Trevor took his trove,
Treetrover Trevor was very old,
Treetrover Trevor heard a sound,
Treetrover Trevor hit the ground.
