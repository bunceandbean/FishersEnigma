Its the big night you have been waiting for,
this night makes you excited and scared to the core
You suit up and grab your bag, running down the street
All of your friends you are going to beat
The first place you know to go
Is the place with the guy who is hosting this show
You knock hard and loud that makes a big beat
And yell those words that every kid finds neat.
