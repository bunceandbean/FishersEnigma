This can be a late stage puzzle

We intermitadly give SCP related puzzles. When they go to the location, there will be a couple of the images left there. (note, they will have no clue what they mean until this stage)

We give them the SCP.png as a guide on this stage, where the first letter of each description is the answer to the photo. letters will be scrambled.

This relies on them taking note of each picture without them knowing what to do with them.
